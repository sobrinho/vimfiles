# vimfiles

Almost vanilla but with a few useful plugins instead of a heavy setup like pretty much any other vimfiles out there.

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tpope/vim-markdown.git ~/.vim
```

## Credits

Special thanks for [@tpope](https://github.com/tpope) for the coolest plugins!
