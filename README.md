# vimfiles

Almost vanilla vim but with couple useful plugins instead of a lot like pretty much any vimfiles out there.

Take a look at [bundle](https://github.com/sobrinho/vimfiles/bundle) to see which one are available and [vimrc](https://github.com/sobrinho/vimfiles/vimrc) to see my keybinds and stuff like that.

## Usage

Chosse a good location like `~/Developer` or `~/Code` and for VIM:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:sobrinho/vimfiles.git

ln -s $PWD/vimfiles ~/.vim
ln -s $PWD/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Or for NVIM:

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:sobrinho/vimfiles.git

mkdir -p ~/.config
ln -s $PWD/vimfiles ~/.config/nvim
```

Special thanks for [@tpope](https://github.com/tpope) for the coolest plugins!
